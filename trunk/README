This is freimap release alpha-1.

Freimap is a visualization environment for community mesh networks with
an OLSR infrastructure. Think "freifunk.net". 

Documentation of the project is still expected to fall from the sky. 
Until then, here's a small outlook of what you can get running and how.

== Requirements ==

* Java 1.5.0 (Java2) or better.
* Either 
** Olsrd running with the dot_draw plugin in the network
** A database containing topology data, according to the provided SQL structure. 
* A few, rather common java libraries which are also provided in a separate convenience package
*# jFreeChart (1.0.4 checked) and jCommon (1.0.8 checked) from jfree.org
*# Mysql J/Connector if database access is used (version 5.0.5 checked)

== Installation == 

=== from convenience JAR archive ===

Assuming that you have the file freimap-all-*.jar in a convenient location.

 > unzip freimap-all-*.jar lib/*
:(will create a ./lib subfolder and extract libraries)

You're done. 

=== Compile from source jar archive === 

 > mkdir freimap
* Copy the jar file into this folder. 
 > jar xvf freimap-dev-*.jar 
:(will create many a subfolder)
 > ./compile 
:(should compile the necessary files with a well-defined classpath, and create a jar file freimap.jar. If not, you'll have to adjust the file)

=== Get the latest from SVN ===

* Follow the instructions at http://developer.berlios.de/svn/?group_id=8309 to obtain an up-to date source tree.
 > ./compile

== Running freimap ==

By now, you should have the file freimap*.jar and a lib subfolder.

 > ./run 
or 
 > java -Xmx500m -jar freimap-*.jar

If you have got less than 500mb free memory, you may want to adjust the 
-Xmx parameter. Freimap does not necessarily need that much unless you 
evaluate many months of collected data using the MysqlDataSource. 

If no configuration file is present, freimap will create such a file and 
abort, so that you can adjust its setting. The configuration file defaults 
to listening at localhost, port 2004 to any OLSRD dot_draw plugin. 


== Using freimap ==


You need geo-information for your network. Currently, this can be read 
either from a Mysql Database, or from a nodes.dump file in the jar package. 
The latter however only provides this data for nodes for a few networks around Berlin and Leipzig currently. Importing from other sources is on my to do list, suggestions are welcome. 

In the main window, you will therefore see a number of white clouds at first. They are the big node concentrations around Berlin and Leipzig. Drag and zoom using your left and right mouse buttons to get closer to the area where you expect to see your network. Press the play button at the bottom of the screen to get live updates and display topology. (If you don't see anything, try to zoom in near Berlin, Alexanderplatz where a big green c-base logo is located. Any node which could not be located is currently placed there - see [[Freimap/Troubleshooting]])

=== Interface ===

The main screen is a map where you can zoom and drag around. Status bars at the top and bottom will tell you about the currently displayed time and the geographical position equivalent to your mouse cursor. 

* Left mouse button: Click and drag to move around the map
* Right mouse button: Click and drag to zoom in and out
* Double click left on any place in the screen to center onto that place.
* Move your mouse over a node or a link to display basic information
* Right click onto a node or link to display advanced statistics. The displayed graphs require a certain minimum of time samples to be available, so that they may not work until after a certain while. 
* Click and drag along the time line on the bottom of the screen to display information about another point in time.
* Click on the play/stop button to display a singe time or move forward within it. 
* A drop down box at the top left of the screen allows you to center on a certain node. Since there are more than thousand registered nodes, it's not that useful currently. 

Enjoy!

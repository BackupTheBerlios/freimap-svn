Freimap is a visualization environment for community mesh networks with
an OLSR infrastructure. Think "freifunk.net". 

Documentation of the project is still expected to fall from the sky. 
Until then, here's a small outlook of what you can get running and how.

== Requirements ==

* Java 1.5.0 (Java2) or better.
* Either 
  - Olsrd running with the dot_draw plugin in the network
  - A database containing topology data, according to the provided SQL 
    structure. 
* A few, rather common java libraries which are also provided in a separate
  convenience package
  - jFreeChart (1.0.4 checked) and jCommon (1.0.8 checked) from jfree.org
  - Mysql J/Connector if database access is used (version 5.0.5 checked)

== Installation == 

=== from convenience JAR archive ===

Assuming that you have the file freimap-*.jar in a convenient location.
* unzip freimap-all-*.jar lib
  (will create a ./lib subfolder and extract libraries)
You're done. 

=== Compile from source === 

* mkdir freimap
* Copy the jar file into this folder. 
* jar xvf freimap-dev-*.jar 
  (will create many a subfolder)
* ./compile 
  (should compile the necessary files with a well-defined classpath, and 
   create a jar file freimap-jar. If not, you'll have to adjust the file)


== Running freimap ==

By now, you should have the file freimap-*.jar and a lib subfolder.

* ./run 
or 
* java -Xmx500m -jar freimap-*.jar

If you have got less than 500mb free memory, you may want to adjust the 
-Xmx parameter. Freimap does not necessarily need that much unless you 
evaluate many months of collected data using the MysqlDataSource. 

If no configuration file is present, freimap will create such a file and 
abort, so that you can adjust its setting. The configuration file defaults 
to listening at localhost, port 2004 to any OLSRD dot_draw plugin. 


== Using freimap ==

You need geo-information for your network. Currently, this can be read 
either from a Mysql Database, or from a nodes.dump file in the jar package. 
The latter however only provides this data for nodes in the Berlin network 
currently. Importing from other sources is on my to do list, suggestions 
are welcome. 

... (to be continued).

Enjoy!
